**This version is compatible with [`EXOTIC` 3.3.0](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC/releases/tag/3.3.0) and earlier [`EXOTIC` releases](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC/releases).**

This package contains styling, interaction, and functional methods that support the use of EXOTIC in Google Colab. It was originally built for UX improvements to EXOTIC. EXOTIC is a Python 3 package for analyzing photometric data of transiting exoplanets into lightcurves and retrieving transit epochs and planetary radii.
